#### B.S. in Physics (Astrophysics Minor) - University of Connecticut
I study physics with an astrophysics minor, with experience in advanced problem solving, quantitative analysis, as well as advanced experimental methods.

#### Strengths
- **Problem solving:** break down complex problems and describe them with simple models.
- **Data analysis:** turn large quantities of data into easily understood and predictable functions, error propagation, graphing.
- **Data acquisition:** precisely calibrate equipment and document all sources of error.
- **Scientific writing:** precise write-ups that ensure repeatability of experimental methods, analysis, and results.

#### Systems & Software
- **Code:** Julia, Python, Mathematica
- **Data Analysis:** Excel (Solver)
- **Instrumentation:** timing equipment, radiation detection, optics, oscillators, particle detection

#### Courses
- Classical Mechancis • Electromagnetism • Statistical Physics
- Advanced Physics Lab • Computational Physics
